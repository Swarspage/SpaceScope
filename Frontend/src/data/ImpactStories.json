    "story": "In 2004, researchers used the microgravity environment of the International Space Station to grow exceptionally pure protein crystals related to muscular dystrophy. The absence of gravity-induced convection allowed crystals to form with unprecedented clarity, enabling scientists to map protein structures in far greater detail than possible on Earth.\n\nThese high-quality crystals provided crucial insights into the molecular mechanisms of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a devastating genetic disorder affecting approximately 1 in 3,500 boys worldwide. The structural data obtained from ISS experiments contributed to the development of potential therapeutic approaches targeting the dystrophin protein.\n\nThis breakthrough demonstrated the practical medical benefits of space-based research. The techniques pioneered through ISS protein crystallography have since been applied to numerous other diseases, from cancer to Alzheimer's, showcasing how investments in space exploration yield tangible benefits for human health on Earth.",
